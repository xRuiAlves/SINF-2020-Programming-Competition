# So many speakers

It looks like there are a lot of people wanting to make a presentation in this year's edition!

## Problem Statement

An important part of organizing an event is keeping the Talks fresh and interesting. It looks like the call for speakers was a great success this year, and there are a lot of candidates! After a more careful look, the team noticed there are thousands and thousands of candidate speakers, which is terrible news - the system has been hacked!

However, it looks like the hackers weren't very smart and didn't follow the submission guidelines for the lecture's title! A valid title must obey the following rules:

- Start with a capital letter;
- Have at least two distinct words (separated by at least one space);
- Include at least one vowel;
- Not include any digits.

Filtering the valid titles by hand would be a nightmare, so it is up to you to automate this process!

## Input Format

The first line indicates the number ***N*** of titles to validate.

There are ***N*** subsequent lines, where each line features a single title to validate.

## Constraints

- 3 <= ***N*** <= 10000

## Output Format

The output should be a single integer, representing the number of valid lecture titles.
