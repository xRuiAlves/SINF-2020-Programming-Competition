# Time to celebrate

The event was a success, now it's time to celebrate!

## Problem Statement

After the event is over, it's time for the organization team to celebrate! This edition was yet another success, and the celebration will consist of a nice dinner.

However, it seems that the organization members are pickier regarding the table seats than one would expect. All members have a list of table seats that they're willing to sit in. Before chaos emerges, your job is to figure out **how many ways you can sit the organization team members**, while making sure you follow their table seat demands.

## Input Format

The first line indicates the number of organization team members ***N***.

There are ***N*** subsequent lines, where each features a list of sit numbers (separated by spaces).

## Constraints

- 2 <= ***N*** <= 30
- Seat numbers are **positive integer** numbers

## Output Format

The output should be a single integer, representing the number of ways the team members may sit.
